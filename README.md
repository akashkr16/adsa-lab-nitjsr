‚öôÔ∏è General Instructions

Language Requirement:
All programs must be implemented in C programming language only.
(C++, Python, Java, etc. are not allowed ‚Äî except for project question 35.)

Error Handling:
Programs should handle all input cases gracefully, including illegal inputs, without crashing.

File Input:
For large inputs (e.g., matrices ‚â• 3√ó4), data should be read from text files to simplify testing and reruns.
